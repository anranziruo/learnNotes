Sleepless in Seattle script
 Mommy got sick. 
 It happened just Iike that. 
 There was nothing anybody couId do. 
 It isn't fair. 
 There's no reason. 
 But if we start asking why, we'II go crazy. 
 Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them. They're done. Ready to eat. 
 Do you know how to make juice? 
 Microwave. Five minutes. 
 Here. 
 My shrink. CaII him. 
 ''Loss of Spouse Support Group.

 Hug YourseIf. Hug a Friend. Hug a Shrink.'' 
 Or work. Work hard. 
 Work wiII save you. Work is the onIy thing that wiII see you through this. 
 Don't mind him. He's just a guy who's lost his wife. 
 What I think we reaIIy need is a change. 
 Good idea. Take a coupIe of weeks off. Get some sun. Take Jonah fishing. 
 No, a real change. 
 A new city. 
 SomepIace where every time I go around a corner I don't think of Maggie. 
 Where you gonna go? 
 I was thinking about SeattIe. 
 EventuaIly, in a few months, you'II start seeing women. 
 - You'lI meet someone. - Right. 
 Move on. Right. That's what I'm gonna do. 
 And then in a few months, boom, I'II be fine. I'Il just grow a new heart. 
 - Sam, I'm sorry. - She didn't mean that. 
 I know. Look, it just doesn't happen twice. 
 You must remember this 
 A kiss is still a kiss 
 A sigh is just a sigh 
 The fundamental things apply 
 As time goes by 
 And when two lovers woo 
 They still say, I love you 
 On that you can rely 
 No matter what the future brings 
 As time goes by 
 Moonlight and love songs 
 Never out of date 
 Hearts full of passion 
 Jealousy and hate 
 Woman needs man 
 And man must have his mate 
 That no one can deny 
 lt's still the same old story 
 A fight for love and glory 
 A case of do or die 
 The world will always welcome lovers 
 As time 
 Goes by 
 The taII one with red hair is your cousin Irene. 
 You'lI recognize her by the disappointed look on her face. 
 Who was married to HaroId who ran off with his secretary. 
 But came back because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't. 
 Your brother Dennis is a professor at Johns Hopkins. 
 He's married to Betsy. 
 The most competitive woman in the worId. 
 I don't see how I'm gonna remember aIl this. 
 Oh, weIl, WaIter, you wiII. 
 Your Uncle MiIton Iost aII of his money-- 
 - And some other people's. - In a pyramid scheme. 
 Don't mention the IRS or the federaI prison system. 
 Your mother's Barbara. Your father's CIiff. 
 - My father has eIectric trains. - ReaIIy? 
 Am I what they had in mind? 
 Oh, WaIter, they're gonna Iove you. 
 Everybody. 
 Annie has an announcement. 
 Walter and I are engaged. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Dad, Mom knew. 
 - I don't see a ring, Annie. - I don't have a ring yet. 
 CongratuIations. 
 BIess you. BIess you. 
 - Oh, my goodness. - Are you aII right? 
 - It's nothing. - Maybe it's the fIowers. 
 - We'Il move them. - No! Don't touch them! 
 I feeI terribIe, sneezing at a time Iike this. 
 This is a very important moment for me. 
 He's alIergic to everything. Don't worry about it. 
 Bees. I'm aIIergic to bees. 
 HaroId is alIergic to every type of bee. 
 We aIways have to carry a hypodermic of adrenaline wherever we go. 
 If he eats even one tiny piece of a nut-- 
 My head swelIs up Iike a watermelon, and I drop dead. 
 It's the same with HaroId and bees. 
 Your mother and I had saImon at our wedding. A wedding without coId saImon-- 
 - I'm not alIergic to saImon. - Oh, he's not alIergic to salmon. 
 I don't think, but you never know. 
 - You never know. - Harold wasn't aIways aIIergic to bees. 
 Honey, what a shame. We had some champagne. What did we use it for? 
 - UncIe MiIton's parole. - And it was deIicious. 
 It was, wasn't it, MiIton? 
 When are you getting married? 
 - In early June, in the garden. - Does it have to be in the garden? 
 - What a great idea. - What about HaroId and bees? 
 - I'm aIIergic to bees. - We'II spray you. 
 CoId saImon, a loveIy cucumber saIad, strawberries. 
 l'm afraid l am aIlergic to strawberries. 
 AIlergic to strawberries. 
 Is this aIl right with you, WaIter? 
 Today l consider myseIf the Iuckiest... 
 m-m-man on the f-f-face of the E-E-Earth. 
 The Lou Gehrig Iine. Remember? Remember, Dad? 
 - The Lou Gehrig Iine from-- - Pride of the Yankees. 
 - Pride of the Yankees! - Pride of the Yankees. 
 - It's basebaII. - A historicaI reference. 
 I would Iike to propose a toast to my kid sister. 
 To WaIter and my baby. 
 To Walter and Annie. 
 Everyone, pIease eat before it gets coId. 
 Here it is. 
 The historicaI society wanted this, and I never wouId give it to them. 
 Oh, Mom! 
 I noticed these things are back in fashion. 
 - Grandmother's dress. - Oh, honey. 
 He's a loveIy man, Annie. 
 I know. He is wonderfuI, isn't he? And he's such a wonderfuI athIete. 
 - Are his folks nice? - You'lI Iove them. 
 We're going down to D.C. tonight to be with them Christmas morning. 
 - How did it happen? - WeII, it's siIIy, reaIly. 
 I'd seen him at the office. ObviousIy, I'd seen him. 
 He's the associate publisher. 
 One day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place. 
 He got my Iettuce and tomato on wheat, which, of course, he was aIIergic to. 
 And I got his lettuce and tomato on white. 
 - How amazing. - It is, isn't it? 
 You make a miIIion decisions that mean nothing. 
 Then one day you order takeout, and it changes your Iife. 
 Destiny takes a hand. 
 Mom, destiny is something we've invented... 
 because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidentaI. 
 How do you expIain that you both ordered the same sandwich except for the bread? 
 How many peopIe in this worId Iike Iettuce and tomato... 
 without something eIse Iike tuna? 
 WeII, it wasn't a sign. It was a coincidence. 
 I was in Atlantic City with my family. CIiff was a waiter. 
 He wasn't even supposed to work that night, and suppose he hadn't? 
 He asked me to take a midnight waIk on the SteeI Pier. 
 I've probabIy toId you this a miIlion times, but I don't care. 
 Then he heId my hand. 
 At one point I Iooked down and I couIdn't teII... 
 which fingers were his and which were mine. 
 And I knew. 
 - What? - You know. 
 - What? - Magic. 
 It was magic. 
 Magic? 
 I knew we'd be together forever and that everything wouId be wonderful... 
 just the way you feel about WaIter. 
 Walter? It's quite a formaI name, isn't it? 
 One of the things I truIy knew was that your father and I... 
 were going to have a wonderfuI time in-- 
 - The sack, I beIieve you caIl it. - Mom! 
 Of course, it took severaI years before everything... 
 worked like cIockwork in that department. 
 So don't be worried if it takes a whiIe. 
 - WelI, we aIready-- - Fine. Fine. Fiddle-de-dee. 
 - How's it working? - Like cIockwork. 
 Oh, honey. 
 - It's a sign. - You don't beIieve in signs. 
 They Ioved you ! I toId you they wouId Iove you, and they Ioved you! 
 - I Iove you. - l Iove you, WaIter. 
 Did anyone ever caII you anything other than WaIter? 
 Nope. 
 Not even when you were young? 
 Nope, not even when I was young. 
 You sure you don't want to drive with me? 
 How wiII I get back to BaItimore on Friday? 
 I forgot the present. I left your stepmother's present inside by accident. 
 When we're oId and gray, you're gonna have to remind me to put my teeth in. 
 I'Il be waIking aII over town, smacking my gums together and not even noticing. 
 - I'Il wait. - You'Il wait? Oh! Right. 
 Don't wait. It's silIy. Go ahead. We're late anyway. 
 I'Il be ten minutes behind you. 
 Sleigh bells jing-a-ling Ring-ting-ting-a-ling too

 - Horses, horses, horses - Welcome to ''You and Your Emotions. " 
 - Laughing all the way - l'm Dr. Marcia fieldstone... 
 broadcasting live across America from the top of the Sears Tower in Chicago. 
 Tonight we're talking about wishes and dreams. 
 - What's your wish this Christmas Eve? - What's your wish? 
 -Maybe the best gift you can give your-- -My wish is to turn the radio station. 
 Subject of this evening's medical update is "You and Your Spleen. " 
 - Your host is-- - Not on your Iife. 
 Coming up, ''Jingle Bells" backwards, sung by the New Jersey-- 
 - Seattle, go ahead. - Hello, this is Jonah-- 
 No last names, Jonah. 
 You sound younger than our usual callers. How old are you? 
 - l'm eight. - Eight. How come you're up so late? 
 - lt's not that late in Seattle. - Of course. You're absolutely right. 
 What's your Christmas wish, Jonah? 
 It's not for me. lt's for my dad. l think he needs a new wife. 
 - You don't like the one he has now? - He doesn't have one now. 
 That's the problem. 
 - Where's your mom? - She died. 
 - l'm so sorry to hear that. - WeII, who can beIieve this? 
 I've been pretty sad, but l think my dad's worse. 
 Have you talked to your dad about this? 
 - No. - Why not? 
 - lt's like it makes him sadder. - l can understand that. 
 - Jonah, is your dad home right now? - Yeah. 
 - What's he doing? ls he busy? - Not really. He's out on the deck. 
 l'm sure that l can help, but l'm going to need you to help me help him. 
 - Wretched woman! - Bring your dad to the phone. 
 - Hang up, Jonah! Don't Iisten to her. - No way. He'd kill me. 
 Trust me, Jonah. He won't be angry... 
 when he realizes how concerned you are about him. 
 Wanna bet? 
 If I get yelled at, l'm never going to listen to your show again. 
 Fair enough. 
 - Dad? - Yeah? 
 There's someone on the phone for you. 
 - His name's Sam. - Sam. 
 If you've just tuned in, this is Dr. Marcia fieldstone. 
 Tonight's topic is ''Your Wishes and Dreams." 
 - I got it. - We're on the line with Seattle. 
 - HeIIo? - Hello, Sam. 
 This is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America. 
 What are you selIing tonight? Micro hibachis or Ginza knives? 
 I'm not selling anything. l just want to help. 
 l want you to know that your son called... 
 and he asked me for advice on how you might find a new wife. 
 - Who is this? - Dr. Fieldstone of Network America. 
 - You are on the air. - You caIIed a radio station? 
 - Sam? Sam? Sam, are you with me? - Yeah. Yes. 
 Your son feels that since your wife's death you've been very, very unhappy. 
 He's genuinely worried about you. 
 Oh, hey, get out here. Get out here. 
 I'm not gonna go through this aIone. 
 l think it's very hard for him to talk to you about all this. 
 I thought maybe you and l could talk. lt would make Jonah feel better. 
 - Sam? - Talk to her, Dad. She's a doctor. 
 Of what? Her first name couId be Doctor. 
 - PIease? - Sam? 
 Sam, it's his Christmas wish. 
 - Okay. - Okay, good. 
 l know this is difficult. 
 But how long ago did your wife die? 
 About a year and a half ago. 
 Have you had any relationships since? 
 - Nope. - No? 
 Why not? 
 Marcia-- Or shouId l caII you Dr. FieIdstone? 
 - Dr. Marcia. - Dr. Marcia. 
 - l don't mean to be rude. - I don't want to invade your privacy. 
 - Oh, sure you do. - Sure you do. 
 Go on, Sam. l'm listening. 
 Sam? 
 We had a pretty tough time there at first. 
 But we're deaIing with it. 
 And Jonah and l wilI get aIong just fine again... 
 as soon as I break his radio. 
 l have no doubt that you're a wonderful father. 
 - You can tell a lot from a voice. - You certainIy can. 
 But something must be missing if Jonah still feels you're under a cloud. 
 Just a few questions. Are you sleeping at night? 
 - He doesn't sIeep at aII. - How do you know that? 
 I live here. 
 Look, it's Christmas. 
 Maggie, my wife-- 
 She reaIIy did it. 
 I mean, she Ioved-- 
 She made everything beautifuI. 
 And it's just tough this time of year. 
 Any kid needs a mother. 
 Could it be that you need someone just as much as Jonah does? 
 Yes. 
 Don't answer that. Let's get into that right after these messages. 
 Sam, Jonah, don't go away. 
 lf you've just tuned in, we're talking to Sleepless in Seattle. 
 We'll be right back after this break with your listener response. 
 What's she taIking about? 
 This is when other peopIe get to calI in and dump on what you said. 
 Oh, oh. This is realIy fun, and heIpful. 
 I'II bet he's taII with a cute butt. 
 Bet he hasn't bathed in weeks and he stinks. 
 Harriet, shut up. Hi. Can I heIp you? 
 Tea with the bag out. 
 Maybe I'lI hustIe myseIf out to SeattIe. Give him a gift for New Year's Eve. 
 You go on out there if you want to, but don't open his refrigerator. 
 They don't cover anything when they put it in the fridge. 
 They just stick it in there and Ieave it tiII it walks out by itseIf. 
 What I'm saying is, I wouIdn't kick this guy out of my bed for eating crackers. 
 You know what I'm saying? Sixty-five cents. 
 Let's take a call before we get back to Sleepless. 
 Knoxville, Tennessee, you're on the air. Talk to me. 
 Yes, I would just like to know where l could get this man's address. 
 - Honey, get in Iine. - We don't give that information. 
 Next caller, go ahead. 
 lf there was one question l was allowed to ask-- 
 Oh, go ahead. 
 People who truly loved once are far more likely to love again. 
 Do you think there's someone out there you could love as much as your wife? 
 WeII, Dr. Marcia FieIdstone, that's hard to imagine. 
 What are you going to do? 
 WeII, I'm going to get out of bed every morning... 
 breathe in and out alI day Iong. 
 Then after a while l won't have to remind myself... 
 to get out of bed in the morning and breathe in and out. 
 And then after a whiIe I won't have to think about how... 
 I had it great and perfect for a whiIe. 
 Sam, tell me what was so special about your wife? 
 Well, how long is your program? 
 Oh, well, it was a-- 
 lt was a million tiny little things. 
 When you added them all up, it just meant we were supposed to be together. 
 And l knew it. l knew it the very first time l touched her. 
 It was Iike coming home... 
 onIy to no home I'd ever known. 
 I was just taking her hand... 
 to heIp her out of a car... 
 and l knew it. 
 lt was like-- 
 - Magic. - Magic. 
 Well, folks, it's time to wrap it up. 
 l'm Dr. Marcia fieldstone in Chicago. 
 And to all my listeners, a magical and merry Christmas. 
 And to you, Sleepless in Seattle, we hope you'll call again soon. 
 - Let us know how it's going. - Oh, you can count on it. 
 When you find me 
 l know somewhere 
 Over the rainbow 
 The bluebirds glide 
 Birds fly 
 Over the rainbow 
 Why, then, oh, why 
 Can't I 
 This man seIIs the greatest soup you've ever eaten... 
 and he is the meanest man in America. 
 I feeI very strongIy about this, Becky. It's not just about the soup. 
 - Do it. What eIse? - New Year's Eve. 
 - PIease don't make me write it. - Listen to this. 
 ''Phone service in the greater Chicago area was tied up for two hours... 
 Christmas Eve when some kid caIIs a phone-in radio show... 
 and says that his dad needs a new wife. 
 Two thousand women caIIed the station asking for the guy's number.'' 
 I heard it. This kid caIIs up and says, ''My dad needs a wife.'' 
 This shrink forces the guy to the phone and says, ''You want to taIk about it?'' 
 He says, ''No, as a matter of fact, I don't.'' 
 Suddenly, for no reason at aII, he taIks about how much he Ioved his wife... 
 and how he just feII in Iove with her... 
 Iike he was one of those cows in Michigan. 
 - What cows in Michigan? - It was on 60 Minutes. 
 There were those cows that got zapped by stray voItage. 
 No one knows why. Maybe it was Wisconsin. 
 But anyway, I was Iistening to him taIk about how much he Ioved his wife... 
 and suddenIy I was crying. 
 It's Iike what happens when I watch those phone company ads. 
 l don't have to see the whoIe thing, just the part where... 
 the daughter gives the mother the refrigerator with the big red bow on it. 
 The PoIaroid commerciaI. Two 5-year-oIds at their grandfather's birthday party. 
 - They're making the aIbum. - With the gIue. 
 That kilIs me. 
 You shouId write something about this. 
 - About what? - Whatever it is. 
 I'II teII you. Two thousand women caIIing a radio station for a husband. 
 There are a lot of desperate women out there Iookin' for Iove. 
 EspeciaIIy over a certain age. 
 lt's easier to be kiIIed by a terrorist than get married over the age of 40. 
 That is not true. That statistic is not true. 
 That's right. It's not true. But it feeIs true. 
 It feeIs true because it is true. 
 There's practicaIIy a whoIe book about how that's not true. 
 - CaIm down. You brought it up. - I did not, Wyatt. 
 -Did you even read that book? -Did anyone read it aII the way through? 
 Are you two finished? Fine. Now where were we? 
 If someone is a widower, why do they say that he was widowed? 
 Why don't they say he was widowered? 
 I was just wondering. 
 What was that about up there? 
 - What was what? - What's with you? 
 - Nothing's with me. - Something's with you. 
 - What are you saying? - Whatever it is, you can teII me. 
 SIeepIess in SeattIe? 
 That's what she caIIed him on the show because he can't sIeep. 
 And now 2,000 women want his number. 
 The guy couId be a crackhead, a transvestite... 
 a fIasher, a junkie, a chain-saw murderer... 
 or someone reaIly sick, someone Iike my Rick. 
 - ActuaIIy, he sounded nice. - Oh? 
 Oh, reaIIy? Now we're getting down to it. 
 PIease. Becky, I'm madIy in Iove with WaIter. 
 He did the craziest thing the other night. What was that? 
 Oh, it was so funny. We were hystericaI. What was that? 
 You know, I've got to go to Boston for the convention, right? 
 Then I got to visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers. 
 But why don't we meet in New York for VaIentine's Day weekend? 
 WaIter, I'd Iove to! 
 We can stay at the Plaza. 
 Ice-stake in CentraI Park. 
 Register. 
 Register? 
 You know, for dishes, gIasses, siIver, everything. 
 How about it? 
 I'Il take you to Chinatown for dim sum. 
 - Does it have wheat in it? - I don't think so. 
 Dim sum, dim sum 
 Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... 
 five, four, three, two, one! 
 Hey, Jonah. Wake up. Wake up, man. The baII's droppin'. 
 Happy new year! 
 Okay, paI. I got ya. 
 lt's okay. 
 There we go. 
 Happy new year. 
 Happy new year. 
 Kiss Howard. 
 Good night, Howard. 
 Sometimes I wonder 
 Why l spend 
 The lonely night 
 Dreaming of a song 
 The melody 
 Haunts my reverie 
 And l am once again with you 
 When our love was new 
 And each kiss an inspiration 
 But that was long ago 
 Now my consolation 
 ls in the stardust of a song 
 Beside the garden wall 
 When stars are bright 
 You are in my arms 
 The nightingale 
 Tells his fairy tale 
 Of paradise where roses bloom 
 Can I have half your beer? 
 Sure. Go ahead. 
 What did l used to say? 
 ''Here's Iooking at you''? 
 ''Here's mud in your eye''? 
 ''Here's to us.'' 
 You used to say, ''Here's to us.'' 
 Oh, babe. I miss you so much it hurts. 
 - What do you want to do? - We'lI teII him when he gets here. 
 You want to teII him. I don't mind teIling him. 
 - She's here. - She's back. She has another idea. 
 l don't need-- Claire, how are you? 
 I'm so gIad you're here. I heard you on the radio. 
 - I toId everyone about it. - We aIready knew. 
 - How did you-- - Grace. 
 The dispatcher? AII of SeattIe knows. 
 I was brushing my teeth and suddenly there you were. 
 I couIdn't beIieve my ears. I caIIed my mother in Las Vegas. 
 l said, ''Mother, turn on the radio. That's my architect.'' 
 It is so nice... 
 when a man can express his feeIings. 
 - It's wonderful. - I wish l couId express my feeIings. 
 - So, CIaire, is there a problem? - I was tossing and turning last night. 
 I reaIized I'm never going to fit my pIatters in the refrigerator we ordered. 
 When I give parties, I aIways put in pIatters. 
 So I thought I wouId get the Sub-Zero refrigerator instead. The onIy probIem-- 
 We have to redo aII the cabinets. 
 - We'II be into this waII. - That's a bearing waII. 
 That's a deIay, Claire, of-- 
 - Two, three-- - Five, six-- 
 - TweIve weeks. - I don't mind. 
 The important thing is to get it right. 
 - AbsoIuteIy. - Your words. 
 I've got to rush. La decorateur caIIs. 
 - Bye! - Bye-bye. 
 WeII, this is fate. She's divorced. 
 We don't want to redo the cabinets, and you need a wife. 
 What do they caII that when everything intersects? 
 The Bermuda TriangIe. 
 And here's another one. You got room for one more here? 
 There you go. You aII right there? 
 -Look at this, Dad. They're aII for you. -Yes, sir. There you go. 
 '"SIeepIess in SeattIe. In care of Dr. Marcia FieIdstone''? 
 If you have troubIe sIeeping, drink a gIass of water from the other side. 
 - I thought that was for hiccups. - Does it work for hiccups? 
 For hiccups, take a spoonful of sugar and hoId it in your mouth for a minute. 
 - RealIy? - Thank you. 
 What possessed you to give them our address? 
 They caIIed and asked for it. 
 ''Dear SIeepIess in Seattle... 
 You're the most attractive man I ever Iaid ears on.'' 
 Wait, wait, wait. They caIled? How did they get our number? 
 Let me guess. You gave it to them. 
 You have to give them your phone number, or they won't Iet you on the air. 
 ''Dear SIeepIess in SeattIe, l Iive in TuIsa.'' 
 - Where's that? - It's in OkIahoma. 
 - Do you know where OkIahoma is? - Somewhere in the middIe. 
 I'm not even gonna think about what they're not teaching you in schooI. 
 Yeah, it's somewhere in the middIe. 
 GeneraIIy speaking, we should ruIe out anyone that doesn't Iive near here. 
 She's wilIing to fIy anywhere. 
 She looks Iike my third grade teacher. I hated my third grade teacher. 
 Wait a minute. She is my third grade teacher! 
 - Aren't you gonna read any of these? - This is not how it's done. 
 I'd much rather just see somebody I Iike... 
 and get a feeling about them... 
 and ask them if they want to have a drink. 
 - Or a sIice of pizza? - Not dinner. 
 Not necessarily on the first date. 
 HaIfway through dinner you couId be reaIIy sorry you asked them to dinner. 
 Whereas, if it's just a drink... 
 if you Iike them, you couId aIways ask them to dinner. 
 But if not, you can just say, ''WeIl, that was great.'' 
 And then you go home. See what I mean? 
 I wonder if it stiII works this way. 
 - lt doesn't. They ask you. - I'm starting to notice that. 
 If you get a new wife, I guess you'Il have sex with her, huh? 
 I certainIy hope so. 
 - WiII she scratch up your back? - What? 
 In movies, women are aIways scratching up the man's back and screaming. 
 - How do you know this? - Jed's got cabIe. 
 Oh, Jed's got cabIe. 
 Hand me that towel behind you, pIease. 
 - Thank you. - I need it too. 
 Here. Let me get you. Jed's got cabIe. 
 Another bride 
 Another groom 
 Another sunny honeymoon 
 Another season 
 And that's the reason for makin' whoopee 
 When the sun is high in the afternoon sky 
 You can always find something to do 
 But from dusk till dawn as the clock ticks on 
 Something happens to you 
 ln the wee small hours 
 Of the morning 
 While the whole wide world 
 ls fast asleep 
 You lie awake 
 And think about the boy 
 And never ever think 
 Of counting sheep 
 Welcome back to the ''Best of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"... 
 clinical psychologist and the friend you never had. 
 - Remember Marooned in Miami? - He says he doesn't love me anymore. 
 Why would you want to be with someone who doesn't love you? 
 Disappointed in Denver. 
 Every time I come close to orgasm, he goes to make himself a sandwich. 
 Why don't you make him a sandwich beforehand? 
 Sleepless in Seattle. 
 Well, l'm going to get out of bed every morning... 
 and breathe in and out all day long. 
 Then after a while l won't have to remind myself... 
 to get out of bed in the morning and breathe in and out. 
 And then after a while l won't have to think about how... 
 l had it great and perfect for a while. 
 Sam, tell me what was so special about your wife? 
 Well, how long is your program? 
 Oh, well, it was a-- 
 lt was a million tiny little things. 
 When you added them all up, it just meant we were supposed to be together. 
 And l knew it. l knew it the very first time l touched her. 
 lt was like coming home... 
 only to no home l'd ever known. 
 l was just taking her hand... 
 to help her out of a car... 
 and l knew it. 
 lt was like... 
 magic. 
 I think I'm going crazy, Dennis. Are you happiIy married? 
 - What? - l mean, why did you get married? 
 Was it aIl trumpets and fireworks? 
 I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married... 
 so we got married. 
 But when you first met her... 
 did you beIieve she was the onIy person for you? 
 That in some mysticaI, cosmic way it was fated? 
 Annie, when you're attracted to someone... 
 it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious... 
 subconsciousIy. 
 What we think of as fate is two neuroses knowing they're a perfect match. 
 I don't even know him. 
 l am having alI of these fantasies about some man l have never even met... 
 who lives in SeattIe! 
 It rains nine months of the year in SeattIe. 
 I know! I know! I do not want to move to SeattIe. 
 But what I reaIIy don't want to do is end up aIways wondering... 
 what might have happened and knowing l couId have done something. 
 What do you think? 
 It's just coId feet, isn't it? 
 Everybody panics before they get married. Didn't you? 
 - I did. - You did. 
 Thank you very much, Dennis. l feeI so much better just having bIown this off. 
 Anytime. 
 Sandy has a girlfriend, GIenda. She's a weight Iifter. 
 It's not Iike her neck is bigger than her head. 
 I'm not asking you to set me up. I don't need your heIp with that. 
 I just want to know what it's Iike out there. 
 That's what l'm trying to teII you, what women are Iookin' for. 
 Pecs and a cute butt. 
 - Like, ''He has the cutest butt''? - Yeah. 
 - Where did I hear that recently? - Everywhere. 
 You can't even turn on the news nowadays without hearing about... 
 how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute. 
 Who the first woman to say this was, I don't know. But it caught on. 
 So how's my butt? 
 - Not bad. - ReaIIy? 
 - ls it cute though? - I don't know. 
 Are we grading on a curve? 
 When's the Iast time you were out there? 
 Jimmy Carter, 1978. 
 Things are a IittIe different now. 
 First you have to be friends. You have to Iike each other. 
 Then you neck. This couId go on for years. 
 Then you have tests. Then you get to do it with a condom. 
 The good news is, you split the check. 
 I don't think I could Iet a woman pay for dinner. 
 Great. They'II throw a parade in your honor. 
 You'Il be man of the year in Seattle magazine. 
 Tiramisu. 
 - What is tiramisu? - You'II find out. 
 - What is it? - You'II see. 
 Some woman wiII want me to do it to her. I'm not going to know what it is. 
 You'Il Iove it. 
 This is going to be tough. Tough, tough. 
 This is going to be much tougher than I thought it was going to be. 
 How about that decorator on the Bennett job? 
 - Victoria? - Yeah, she's perk. 
 - No, I don't-- - Come on ! 
 I'm far away from that. 
 - I'm just assembIing notes. - Notes. 
 - How wouId I do that? - What do you mean? CaII her up. 
 You say, "'Let's get together. We'Il Iook at swatches.'' 
 CaII her on the phone? Say, ''Let's Iook at swatches''? 
 - Color schemes. - She's not gonna see through that? 
 You don't do it Iike I do it. You do it in your own suave way. 
 Think Cary Grant. 
 Cary Grant wouId say, ''Come Iook at my swatches''? 
 Maybe he did. I know he didn't do it in the movies. 
 Gunga Din? 
 Gunga Din is not a swatch kind of movie. 
 Who knows what he did in reaI Iife? 
 But he did that with Dyan Cannon? 
 ''HeIIo, Dyan. Take a Iook at these swatches.'' 
 Jonah, I'm home. 
 Hey, Jonah ! 
 Hi, Dad. This is Jessica. 
 WeII, it's nice to meet you, Jessica. 
 Dad, this is amazing. lf you pIay this backwards, it says, ''PauI is dead.'' 
 Yeah, I know. 
 How do you know? 
 Dad, couId you shut the door? 
 Sure. Sure. 
 H and G. 
 Hi and good-bye. 
 l'm back in the saddle again 
 Out where a friend is a friend 
 Where the longhorn cattle feed on the lowly jimsonweed 
 Back in the saddle again 
 Ridin' the range once more 
 Totin' my old .44 
 Where you sleep out every night 
 HeIlo, Victoria? 
 This is Sam BaIdwin. I don't know if you remember me, but-- 
 Oh, great. Hi. 
 l was wondering if-- 
 if you wouId Iike to have a drink with me? 
 Dinner? 
 Dinner would be even better. 
 Friday wouId be great. Yeah. How-- 
 I hear that's a good pIace. 
 How-- 7:30 wouId be fine. And I'lI-- 
 Okay, I'II meet you there. Okay. 
 So it's Friday... 
 at 7:30 for dinner. 
 Great. 
 Me too. Bye. 
 Back in the saddle again 
 Are you in love with him? 
 l'm not now. 
 Now those were the days when peopIe knew how to be in Iove. 
 - You're a basket case. - They knew it. 
 Time, distance, nothing couId separate them, because they knew it was right. 
 - It was reaI. It was-- - A movie. 
 That's your probIem. You don't want to be in Iove. 
 You want to be in love in a movie. 
 Read it to me. 
 ''Dear SIeepIess and Son, I have never written a Ietter like this in my Iife.'' 
 That's what everyone writes at the beginning of Ietters to strangers. 
 I know that. You think I don't know that? 
 What about WaIter? 
 Walter. Oh, I wouId give anything to marry WaIter. 
 He's so unexpected. 
 You think you can telI what he's like by just looking at him, but you can't. 
 l shouId write something in this about magic. 
 - What? - Something. 
 What if l never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him? 
 Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick. 
 ''I want to meet you--'' 
 - The top of the Empire State Building? - The top of the Empire State BuiIding. 
 That's perfect. 
 Sunset, VaIentine's Day. 
 I'Il be in New York with WaIter. I can squeeze it in. 
 I'II be in New York with Walter. 
 Do you want to hear about destiny? 
 lf l hadn't married Martin, I wouldn't have had the house with the dead tree. 
 On account of which, I got divorced. 
 On account of which, I hit a car and met Rick whiIe buying a neck brace. 
 Wait. You never toId me you got a divorce because of a dead tree. 
 The tree man. 
 You feII in love with the tree man? 
 I did not say ''Iove.'' Did I say ''Iove''? 
 This is my favorite part. 
 lt's now or never. 
 "Never" is a frightening word. 
 We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by. 
 Winter must be cold for those with no warm memories. 
 We've already missed the spring. 
 Men never get this movie. 
 I know. 
 Mommy! Mommy! 
 lt's okay. I'm here. 
 - Dad! - l'm comin'. 
 It's aII right. lt's okay. 
 It's aII right. It's okay. What was that about? 
 - It was sinking. - What was? 
 Our house. There was water coming in aIl the windows. 
 WeII, it's okay now. 
 It's aII right. So what shouId we do? 
 Your mother used to... 
 sing to you when you had bad dreams. 
 ''Bye-Bye, BIackbird.'' 
 I miss her. 
 What do you think happens to someone after they die? 
 - I don't know. - Like, do you beIieve in heaven? 
 I never did. 
 Or the whole idea of an afterIife, but now I don't know. 
 'Cause I have these dreams about-- 
 about your mom. 
 And we have Iong taIks... 
 about you, how you're doin'. 
 Which she sort of knows, but I telI her anyway. 
 So what is that? 
 It's sort of an afterIife, isn't it? 
 l'm starting to forget her. 
 She couId peeI an appIe... 
 in one Iong... 
 curIy strip. 
 The whoIe appIe. 
 Pack up all my cares and woes 
 Feelin' low 
 Here l go 
 l say bye-bye 
 I Iove you, Jonah. 
 I Iove you, Dad. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 Sugar's sweet So is she 
 l say bye 
 Bye 
 Blackbird 
 No one seems to love 
 Or understand me now 
 Oh, and hard luck stories 
 They keep handin' me, yeah 
 Where somebody shines a light 
 l'm comin' on home tonight now 
 Oh, Lord Yeah, darlin' 
 l wanna say Bye-bye, blackbird 
 Lord have mercy 
 Somebody love me now 
 Laurie? Hi, it's Annie. 
 Fine. I'm fine. 
 Listen. I'm doing an articIe on caIl-in radio shows. 
 Do you know anyone who works for someone named Dr. Marcia FieIdstone? 
 I'm a writer for the Baltimore Sun and a friend of Laurie Johnson's. 
 I'm doing a piece on how peopIe handIe bereavement... 
 and I understand you had a caIIer the other night, some guy from Seattle. 
 This is Jonah Baldwin. We're not in right now, but you can leave-- 
 Architect. 
 Okay, CIarise, I'm gonna be back either by midnight... 
 or 8:30, if disaster strikes. 
 Here's one for both of us. 
 - ''SIeepIess and Son, BaItimore.'' - I Ieft the restaurant's phone number. 
 If there's a problem, the pediatrician's number is right above the phone. 
 Here's a bottIe of ipecac if anybody drinks poison. By the juice gIasses. 
 - Fine. - How do I Iook? 
 - Great. - Do l Iook okay? 
 Do I Iook aII right? I Iook stupid. I Iook Iike I'm tryin' too hard. 
 I was gonna get a haircut, but then I'd Iook Iike I got one. 
 -This is a good Ietter, Dad. -The heeIs on these shoes are grotesque. 
 Looks Iike I'm tryin' to be taII. 
 Her name is Annie. Annie Reed. 
 - Bye. - Read this! 
 Read this! 
 ''Dear SIeepIess and Son, I've never written--'' BIah, bIah. 
 ''I've been an exceIIent third baseman for as Iong as l remember... 
 and whiIe we're on the subject, Iet's just say that... 
 Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. 
 lt's important you agree with me, because I'm from BaItimore.'' 
 She thinks Brooks Robinson's the greatest. So do you. 
 - Everyone thinks he's the greatest. - It's a sign. 
 Come here. 
 I'lI show you a sign. Here's a sign. 
 AII right. 
 Where is Seattle? Right. 
 Where is BaItimore? 
 It's right there! Look! 
 One, two, three, four-- There's Iike 26 states between here and there. 
 Now that's a sign. 
 I'm outta here. Good-bye. Good night. 
 I Iove you. 
 Clarise, did you move your car? 
 - Thank you, Derrick. - You're welcome. 
 - I'll have... - White wine? 
 - And you, sir? - I'm fine, thank you. 
 - You look good. - You look good yourself. 
 - I thought you were never gonna call me. - You did? 
 But I really wanted you to, and I thought you were never going to. 
 - Excuse me, Mr. Baldwin? - Yes? 
 There's a phone call for you. 
 Thank you. Hello? 
 Dad, can we go to New York City for Valentine's Day? 
 What? 
 Annie Reed from Baltimore wants to meet us.... 
 at the top of the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day. 
 - Jonah. - What? 
 Have you fallen down? Are you bleeding? 
 Is Clarise there? Has she been strangled? 
 So this is the only reason for this phone call? 
 If we book now, we can get an excursion fare. 
 Jessica's parents are travel agents, and Jessica says... 
 I'm not going to have this conversation now. 
 We will talk about it at a later time. 
 I can't believe this conversation has lasted this long. You go to bed. 
 Everything all right? 
 Oh, yeah. Do you have kids? 
 - No. - Want mine? 
 I will have an Absolut straight up, please. 
 Sure. 
 Put that down! Stop it! 
 There she is. 
 - Why is she bringing those groceries? - She's cooking for us, so be prepared. 
 Hi, Sam. Thanks. Thanks. 
 And let me guess. You must be Jonah. 
 - This it? - Yeah. 
 - The car's down this way. - Great. 
 She's on her sixth painter... 
 and we're never gonna finish this job. 
 Now she wants the fireplace re-bricked. 
 I know her pretty well. I could give her a call. 
 I've got it solved. I'm just gonna hit her with one of those fireplace bricks. 
 Oh, that is so funny. You are so funny. 
 Whenever she wants anything done, she does this song and dance about... 
 "I don't know. I'm stupid. You tell me. 
 You know better than I, but couldn't we flip the house... 
 so everything on one side is now on the other, and the back becomes the front? 
 Could the whole house open up on a hinge? 
 That way I could just get in with the garage door opener." 
 I just say, "Yeah, we can do that. We're just gonna have to... '' 
 "Move the kitchen cabinets." 
 Jonah, bring that stuff. 
 Do you like baseball? 
 Yes, I do. 
 My firm has box seats to the Mariners. Why don't we all go sometime? 
 - What about camping? - What about it? 
 - Do you like camping? - I went camping once. 
 You know what? We oughta start camping more often. 
 You're right. Camping is good. Time for bed. 
 - It's only 10:00. - Yeah, 10:00. 
 Time for bed. 
 Good night. 
 Don't you wanna thank Victoria for this delicious dinner? 
 Thanks for dinner. I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way. 
 I'm glad you liked it. 
 Good night, Jonah. 
 Yeah, we don't see a lot of potatoes around here. 
 We're rice men. 
 I'm sorry, Walter. I'm sorry. 
 - Hello? - Turn on your radio. 
 - What? - The kid is on. 
 You've got me listening to this garbage. 
 Who is it? 
 It's Becky. She's... She's having trouble with Rick again. 
 I'll go downstairs, Becky. I'll call you back. 
 I'm sorry, Walter. Are you bleeding? 
 - He's kissing her right this minute! - Oh, really? 
 Jonah, tell the truth. Are you spying on your father? 
 - Who's he kissing right this minute? - Listen to this. 
 I have to make them stop. 
 - How am I gonna explain this to Walter? - She came over and cooked dinner. 
 She brought two bags of groceries, like she was staying for a year. 
 Jonah, it's good that your father's dating. 
 It's just hard on you. It's something you think you want. 
 - Then when it happens, it scares you. - That's not true. 
 Think. Shouldn't your father be the judge.... 
 of whether someone is right or wrong for him? 
 He's not sane enough to judge anything. 
 Now he's kissing her on the lips. She's a 'ho! 
 My dad's been captured by a 'ho! What am I going to do? 
 Calm down, Jonah. 
 Tomorrow morning when you're having breakfast with your dad.... 
 tell him how you feel. 
 It's not good to keep your feelings inside you. 
 Miss Scarlet. In the broom closet. With the radio. 
 You scared me. Don't ever do that again. 
 - I thought I saw a black widow. - You scared me to death! 
 - You scared Victoria to death. - It was right over there. 
 The next time you think you see a black widow spider, I want you to say... 
 "Dad, excuse me, but I believe a poisonous insect is in the house''... 
 and I will calmly come and take care of it. 
 Scream again, I'll kill you. 
 Becky heard this guy on the radio she was sure was Rick. She was hysterical. 
 And then it turned out the guy lived in Duluth. 
 - Where is Duluth? - That doesn't make any sense. 
 I know, Walter. It doesn't make any sense at all. 
 Thank God my life is in place. 
 Duluth? That's in North Dakota. 
 I love this letter. You have to write to her. 
 - You think so? - It's Y.O.H. 
 Yeah. What's that? 
 Your only hope. 
 I thought I would look into doing a story on those radio shows. 
 You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it. 
 Definitely. 
 Couldn't you do a phone interview? 
 Not for the kind of piece I wanna do. I won't be in Chicago that long. 
 When you get back, I'll be gone. 
 And then I'll see you in New York. 
 I'll get it. 
 This is Captain Browning. 
 We're at our cruising altitude of approximately 35,000 feet. 
 The weather is clear to the west, and we expect to arrive in Seattle on schedule. 
 - Don't you hate flying? - Yes, I do. 
 And I just told the most terrible one to the man I'm about to marry. 
 Do you feel that any lie is a betrayal? 
 I said ''flying." 
 Thanks for bringing me out here. 
 Well, he likes the planes. 
 Can I bring something back for you? A souvenir? Does he like snow globes? 
 You shake them up and then the snow floats down. 
 Sure. I'd really like that. Thank you so much. 
 - He's eight. - He's good at it. 
 I read an article about this. 
 All children are hideous at age eight. It's quite normal. 
 Well, maybe when I come back... 
 the two of us oughta spend some time together on our own. 
 What do you think? 
 Bye. 
 Bye, Jonah. 
 Listen to me. You don't know Victoria. 
 I hardly know her myself. 
 She is, in fact, a mystery to me. 
 She tosses her hair a lot. Why does she do this? 
 I have no idea. Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? 
 Should she use a barrette to keep her hair out of her face? 
 These are things I'm willing to get to the bottom of. 
 And that is why I am dating her. 
 That's all I'm doing. 
 I'm not living with her. I'm not marrying her. 
 Can you appreciate the difference? 
 This is what single people do. 
 They try other people on and see how they fit. 
 But everybody's an adjustment. Nobody's perfect. 
 There's no such thing as a perfect... 
 Come on. 
 Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation. 
 She says you knew Annie in another life. 
 - Who's Annie? - The one who wrote us. 
 But Jessica says you and Annie never got together in that life. 
 So your hearts are like puzzles with missing pieces. 
 And when you get together, the puzzle's complete. 
 Goddamn it. 
 The reason I know this and you don't is because I'm younger and purer... 
 so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces. 
 - Who told you this stuff? - Jessica. 
 I sincerely hope you're not marrying Jessica. 
 I remember the days of just keepin' time 
 Of hangin' around in sleepy towns 
 Forever 
 Back roads empty for miles 
 Well, you can't have a dream and cut it to fit 
 But when I saw you I knew 
 We'd go together 
 Like a wink and a smile 
 Leave your old jalopy 
 By the railroad track 
 We'll get a hip double-dip, tip-toppy 
 Two-seat Pontiac 
 So you can rev her up 
 Don't go slow 
 It's only green lights and all rights 
 Let's go together 
 With a wink and a smile 
 Give me a wink and a smile 
 We go together 
 Like a wink and a smile 
 Now my heart hears music 
 Such a simple song 
 Sing it again The notes never end 
 This is where I belong 
 Just the sound of your voice The light in your eyes 
 We're so far away from yesterday 
 Together 
 With a wink and a smile 
 We go together 
 Like a wink and a smile 
 - I watched him play with his son. - Did you talk to him? 
 I couldn't do it. 
 - How did I get here? - You told a lie and got on a plane. 
 That's not what I mean. 
 I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him. I am. 
 Okay. Good. Good-bye. 
 - Beck? - What? 
 - Is this crazy? - No. 
 That's the weirdest part about it. 
 Thank you. I love you. 
 - I love you too. - Good night. 
 Oh, it's so good to see you. Where's Greg? 
 Hello. 
 - So then what happened? - So then I left, obviously. 
 You were standing in the middle of the street? 
 You know that dream when you're on the street naked and everyone is looking? 
 I love that dream. 
 That was nothing compared to this humiliation. Nothing. 
 - But he saw you, right? - He saw me. 
 - You were face-to-face? - He said hello. 
 - He said hello, and what did you say? - All I could say was hello. 
 Oh, my God! 
 And all I could say was hello. 
 It's a sign. 
 It's a sign that I have watched this movie too many times. 
 So stupid. 
 Since I listened to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk. 
 - You are not a jerk. - Thank you. 
 - Idiot. - You don't know who she was. 
 I saw her. I have a picture of her. I'II show you a picture of her. 
 That detective in Seattle sent me a picture of her. 
 Here. See? 
 That's exactly what she looks like. 
 This is a picture of someone's back. 
 Well, it's her and he was crazy about her. 
 What's this? This is from Seattle. 
 So I mailed your letter. 
 "Dear Annie, thanks for your letter. 
 It was great. You sound neat. 
 We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day... 
 and seeing if we are... 
 M.F.E.O. 
 See you soon. 
 Sleepless in Seattle." 
 M.F. E.O.? 
 Made for each other. 
 It's cute. It's like a little clue. 
 So he can't write. Big deal. 
 Verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy... 
 and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into trouble. 
 I will be running back to Walter's arms, if he'll still have me. 
 - What about the letter? - It means nothing. 
 It was written before I went out there, before the 'ho. 
 The only thing is, she didn't look like a 'ho. 
 She looked like somebody we would've been friends with. 
 - You saw her in the airport, then here? - I tried to talk to her. 
 It was like I knew her. It was weird. 
 Like a déj?vu thing? 
 It was a very French déj?vu-ish kind of thing. Oui. 
 At least you're out there seeing people again. That's terrific. 
 Well, there's really just the one. 
 Victoria. 
 - You don't like Victoria? - She laughs like a hyena. 
 Is this true? 
 Sort of, a little bit. Tell them what you did. 
 Tell 'em about the radio show. They wanna hear it. 
 Tell 'em. Christmas Eve, he phones in one of those radio call-in shows. 
 Tells them I need a new wife. 
 Oh, you're kidding. 
 That's so sweet. 
 - He's obsessed with a lady who wrote me. - You serious? 
 She wants to meet me at the top of the Empire State Building. 
 On Valentine's Day. 
 - It's like that movie. - What movie? 
 An Affair To Remember. Did you ever see it? 
 Oh, God. 
 Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Is it "car" or "cur"? 
 - Cur. - Car. 
 She's gonna meet him at the top of the Empire State Building... 
 only she got hit by a taxi. 
 And he waited and waited. 
 And it was raining, I think. 
 And then... 
 she's too proud to tell him... 
 that she's, uh... 
 crippled. 
 And he's too proud to find out why she doesn't come. 
 But he comes to see her anyway. 
 I forget why, but, oh... 
 Oh, it's so amazing when he comes to see her because... 
 he doesn't even notice that she doesn't get up to say hello. 
 And he's very bitter. 
 And you think that he's just gonna walk out the door... 
 and never know why she's just lying there, you know, on the couch... 
 with this blanket over her shriveled little legs. 
 - Are you all right? - She's fine. 
 Suddenly he goes, "I already sold the painting." 
 And he like goes to the bedroom... 
 and he looks and he comes out and he looks at her and he kind of just... 
 They know and then they hug. And it's so... 
 - That's a chick's movie. - I would say so. 
 What kind of a person would write to someone they heard on the radio? 
 I got hundreds of letters from women all over the country. 
 Desperate women. 
 Just because someone is looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate. 
 How about rapacious and love-starved? 
 It is easier to be killed by a terrorist than to find a husband after the age... 
 That is absolutely untrue. 
 Right, honey. Right. 
 I'm not lookin' for a mail-order bride. 
 I just want somebody that I can have a decent conversation with over dinner... 
 without it fallin' down into weepy tears over some movie. 
 She's very emotional. 
 - But I cried at The Dirty Dozen. - Who didn't? 
 Jim Brown is throwin' these hand grenades down these air shafts... 
 and Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin were sittin' on top of this... 
 armored personnel carrier, dressed up like Nazis. 
 They're waiting. Trini López... 
 He busted his neck when they were parachuting down behind the Nazi lines. 
 Stop it. 
 Richard Jaeckel had on this shiny helmet 'cause he was the M.P. 
 No more. 
 Oh, God, I love that movie. 
 This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life. 
 What's so great about it? 
 You have to find her. You have to go to her. 
 Do you know how much money it costs to go to New York? 
 Nobody knows. 
 It changes practically every day. How much money do you have? 
 Eighty dollars. 
 I have 42. That would probably cover taxicabs. 
 How would I get there? 
 Honey, I have to run these tickets over to someone. 
 Can you keep an eye on things? 
 Sure, Mom. 
 - Do you want a window seat or an aisle? - Window. 
 - Do you want a fruit plate? - I don't know. Do I? 
 I'd rather die than eat airplane food. 
 I'm telling them you're 12 so you can fly unaccompanied... 
 and the stewardess won't carry you around. 
 Are you crazy? Who'd believe I'm 12? 
 If it's in the computer, they believe anything. 
 Are you sure? 
 Do you want me to say that you're really short for your age... 
 and that they shouldn't say anything 'cause it would hurt your feelings? 
 Yeah, that's a great idea. 
 Sometimes it's hard to be 
 A woman 
 Givin' all your love 
 To just one man 
 Walter. 
 - You're gonna miss the train. - No, I'm not. 
 I'm so happy, Becky. Finally I feel happy. 
 This is right. This is real. 
 Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies... 
 and you completely lose sight of what counts. 
 Please, don't tell anybody what happened. 
 I would be so absolutely mortified if anyone knew... 
 I did anything even remotely close to what I've done. 
 - Thank you. Do you promise? - I promise. 
 Sleepless in Seattle is history. 
 He's hard to understand 
 And if you love him 
 Oh, be proud of him 
 'Cause after all 
 He's just a man 
 Stand by your man 
 I was... 
 - Go ahead. - You go. 
 Okay. Well, I was just gonna say... 
 that ever since Christmas, you've been different... 
 kind of distracted, distant. 
 But now... 
 it feels as if you're coming back from wherever you were. 
 I am. 
 I was just, uh... 
 I just got... I think I got nervous. 
 But that's normal, right? 
 I mean, don't you ever feel nervous about... 
 You know? 
 What? 
 Forever. 
 I did, and you know what I think? 
 I think I thought it was too perfect, you know? 
 I started to wonder if we were the human equivalent... 
 of two rights making a wrong. 
 You know what it was? 
 It was like kismet, but not, if you see what I mean. 
 You have to grow up. 
 You just can't keep having all these adolescent fantasies... 
 about how exciting your life is gonna be. 
 Don't hate me, but I love this pattern. 
 - You couldn't. - I do. 
 This is just like my grandmother's china. 
 How many place settings should I put down? 
 Ten. 
 Exactly. Eight is too few. 
 Twelve is too many. 
 It was my mother's. 
 I had them size it down. 
 She had really fat fingers. 
 It's so beautiful. 
 It's exactly what I would pick out if I had... 
 every ring in the whole world to choose from. 
 You see what I mean? 
 There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises. 
 But I am not one of those people. 
 No, sirree. 
 Surprises are highly overrated. 
 I'm leavin' first thing in the morning, but I'm only gonna be gone one night. 
 Clarise is gonna be here, so you'll be able to see... 
 plenty of Geraldo and Nightmare On Elm Street 12. 
 - I will never know. - Are you going with her? 
 I'm going with Victoria, yes. 
 And don't try anything tricky. Understand? 
 Don't go rollin' in poison ivy as soon as I leave the house... 
 or lock yourself in a closet or do anything that makes you need stitches. 
 If your finger falls off, it's stayin' off. 
 No one's gonna pack it on ice and take you to the hospital... 
 so you can be a breakthrough in laser surgery. 
 - Is this about that woman in Baltimore? - Annie. 
 - I don't care what you do! - Good! Fine! 
 I'll tell you what I'm doin' this weekend. I'm getting laid. 
 1990s and nobody is getting laid. 
 I'm the only man in America who is getting laid this weekend. 
 I haven't been laid that much. Six girls in college, maybe seven. 
 - How long you been standin' there? - Forever. 
 - What did you hear me just say? - "Six girls in college, maybe seven." 
 Seven. Eight! Mary Kelly. 
 This is the one I like. 
 Jonah, the fact is... 
 you're not gonna like any woman because it isn't your mother. 
 How do you know? 
 - What's wrong with Annie? - Oh, Jonah, shut up! 
 Shut up? 
 Mom never said "shut up'' to me. Mom never yelled at me. 
 - The conversation is finished. - Why can't we go to New York? 
 There is no way that we are going on a plane... 
 to meet some woman who could be a crazy, sick lunatic. 
 - Didn't you see Fatal Attraction? - You wouldn't let me. 
 Well, I saw it! And it scared the shit outta me. 
 It scared the shit outta every man in America! 
 I'm not leaving till you say yes. 
 - I hate you! - That's good! 
 You'll have to tell Oprah. 
 How your dad destroyed your life 'cause he had to go off... 
 for a weekend special at the Holiday Inn! 
 Jonah, Clarise is here and I gotta go. 
 Hey, Jonah. 
 All right. Jonah, listen. 
 I gotta go, and I'm... 
 Jessica, honey, you have to tell us where he is. 
 Jonah's daddy is very upset. 
 This is your father. Tell us where he is, right this minute. 
 N.Y. 
 - What is that? - No way. 
 That's N.W. 
 New York. 
 He's on his way to New York. 
 - What? - How? 
 - United 597. - Jessica. 
 - When does it leave? - 7:30. 
 Here you go. Here's a nice pen for you for flying with us. 
 - Thank you. - You're welcome. 
 - Can I take this for you? - No. 
 - Where to, kid? - Empire State Building. 
 Hold on. Empire State Building. 
 Get a little further away from the curb next time, mac. 
 There it is. 
 What you gonna do when you get up there? 
 - Spit off the top? - No. 
 I'm going to meet my new mother. 
 Excuse me. I'm Jonah. Are you Annie? 
 No. I'm Cynthia. 
 Excuse me. Are you Annie? 
 Great table. Thanks. 
 Something wrong? 
 - Can I get you a drink? - Some champagne? 
 Fine. 
 Can we have a bottle... 
 of Dom DeLuise? 
 - Just kidding. - It was a joke. 
 - He meant Dom Pérignon. - I got it. 
 Beautiful view, isn't it? 
 Walter, there's something I have to tell you. 
 Hey, I'm sorry. I have an emergency. 
 Look! Money! All right? 
 - Get right in. - Wait a minute. 
 Taxi! 
 So, he could be on top of the Empire State Building now. 
 I guess he could be. 
 It's not him, Walter. It's me. 
 I can't do this. 
 Look, Annie... 
 I love you, but let's leave that outta this. 
 I don't wanna be someone that you're settling for. 
 I don't wanna be someone that anyone settles for. 
 Marriage is hard enough... 
 without bringing such low expectations into it. 
 Isn't it? 
 Walter, I don't deserve you. 
 I wouldn't put it that way. 
 But, okay. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 - What? - Look. 
 - It's a sign. - Who needed a sign? 
 I have to go. 
 What if something had happened to you? What if I couldn't get to you? 
 I'm sorry. 
 What would I have done? 
 You are my family. You're all I've got. 
 I thought she'd be here. I thought she'd come. 
 We're doin' okay, aren't we? Aren't we all right? 
 - Have I done anything really stupid? - No. 
 - Have I screwed it up for both of us? - No. 
 - Observation deck? - Sorry, ma'am, but it's too late. 
 Please. I really need to get up there. 
 We're closing up. No more runs tonight. 
 Listen. 
 Can I just take a look? There's someone I was supposed to meet. 
 He's probably not there, but if I don't at least look... 
 I'll always wonder about it. 
 Cary Grant, right? 
 You know that movie? 
 One of my wife's favorites. 
 Maybe when we get home we'll get a dog. 
 - Okay. - What do you mean "okay"? 
 - Wouldn't you like to have a dog? - Sure. 
 I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty. 
 Can I take a minute? 
 Go ahead. 
 I left it by the telescopes. 
 - It's you. - It's me. 
 - I saw you in the street. - Are you Annie? 
 Yes. 
 You're Annie? 
 This must be yours. 
 I'm Jonah. This is my dad. 
 - His name's Sam. - Hi, Jonah. 
 - And who's this? - Howard. 
 Oh, Howard. Hello, Howard. 
 We better go. 
 Shall we? 
 It's so important to make someone happy 
 Make just one someone happy 
 Make just one heart the heart you 
 - You sing to - Sam. 
 It's nice to meet you. 
 One face that lights when it nears you 
 One girl you're 
 You're everything to 
 Fame 
 If you win it 
 Comes and goes in a minute 
 Where's the real stuff in life 
 To cling to 
 Love is the answer 
 Someone to love is the answer 
 Once you've found her 
 Build your world around her 
 Make someone happy 
 Make just one someone happy 
 And you will be happy too
